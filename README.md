[Fatum][1] is a **total conversion** mod for **Crusader Kings 2** starting in the 1850s to the current days showcasing the mafia and gangsters factions of **New-York City**.

>To be honest, the project hasn't chenged a lot since 2013, I'm not even sure it can still run today with the last expansions but meh, if someone wants to continue the project ...
