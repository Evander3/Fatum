# 7 - Hanover Square
# For much of the 18th century, Hanover Square was the center of 
# New York's printing trade and retail business. Local shops sold 
# imported books, clothing, glassware, hardware, and furniture, as 
# well as wine, tobacco, and tea. The Bank of New York moved its 
# headquarters to the square in 1787.
